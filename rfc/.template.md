## Overview

_If someone only reads this far, what do you want them to know?_

### Goals and Non-Goals

_What problems are you trying to solve?_
_What problems are not not trying to solve?_

## Motivation and Rationale

_What is the current state of the world?_
_Why is this change being proposed?_
_What are the benefits for users (end-users, engineers, operators, etc.)?_
_Who have you identified as early customers of this change?_

## Timeline

_What is the proposed timeline for the implementation? This timeline should
encompass the entire scope of the project, not just the initial merge of the
code. If applicable, it should include when the feature will be ready for
testing by potential customers, when you will address their feedback, and when
the code will be considered production-ready._

## Design

_What exactly are you doing?_
_What is this change being proposed?_

_This is typically the longest part of the RFC._

### Dependencies

_What existing internal and external systems does this proposal depend on?_
_Are any new dependencies (libraries or systems) being introduced?_

## Drawbacks

_Why should we **not** do this?_

## Prior Art and Alternatives

_What other approaches did you consider?_
_What existing solutions are close but not quite right?_
_How will this project replace or integrate with the alternatives?_

## Known Unknowns

_What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process?_
_What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through implementation before stabilization?_
_What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future?_

## Security, Privacy, and Compliance

_What security/privacy/compliance aspects should be considered?_

_If you are not certain, never assume there aren't any._
_Always talk to the Security SIG or Technical Oversight Committee._

## Operations

_Are you adding any new, regular human processes, or extra work for any users?_
_What telemetry is needed to verify correct behavior?_
_What tooling needs to be introduced for on-going support?_

## Risks

_What known risks exist?_
_What factors may complicate your project?_

_Include: security, complexity, compatibility, latency, service immaturity, lack of team expertise, etc._

## Future Possibilities

_What are the natural extensions and evolution of this RFC that would affect the project as a whole?_

_Feel free to dump ideas here, they're meant to get wheels turning, and won't affect the outcome of the approval process._
