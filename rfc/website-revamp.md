## Overview

spinnaker.io is the public face of the Spinnaker project. This RFC proposes several improvements to .io and a pathway to achieving them.

## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals

The ultimate goal is a more modern looking and consistently styled spinnaker.io.

To that end, these are the specific goals we are working toward: 

* Provide clear entryways and paths for the different personas spinnaker.io should speak to. For example, a more clear and opinionated navigation for someone brand new to Spinnaker.
* Provide a clear and compelling answer to anyone asking, “Why Spinnaker for Continuous Delivery?”
* Add useful documentation features, e.g. versioned documentation and a better in-page table of contents
* Improve operator, end-user, and contributor experience by providing more navigable documentation.
* Improve content organization to facilitate easy contribution.
* Improve local build time and adopt the new way GitHub pages uses themes

### Non-Goals

* Not a complete reorganization of the documentation set. What will happen is the current documentation related tabs will be condensed under a single “Docs” tab in the top navigation.
* Not replatforming or rethemeing .io. The cost/benefit is not there to do this at this time.

## Motivation and Rationale

Spinnaker.io has operated with one basic design look/feel since March 22, 2017. Given the current momentum and size of the project, it is time for a refresh. The Docs SIG feels it’s time to evolve .io beyond a documentation site and into a project hub, providing a presence for Spinnaker that is clearly segmented for different user personas.

We need to provide context to attract new companies and ICs as they encounter Spinnaker. This aligns with Travis Tomsu’s efforts to add more context and persuasive oomph to READMEs across the project. The window for Spinnaker inevitability is threatened by a crowded marketplace and will close; this project will boost Spinnaker’s profile and chances for inevitability.

From a technical standpoint, the way GitHub pages manages themes has changed to remote themes, and our implementation is outdated. Relying on the Minimal Mistakes theme-maintainer’s repository results in less theme-related maintenance for the Docs SIG and capture of theme feature improvements.

## Timeline
* Achieve buy-in from stakeholders by March.
* Finalize Statement of Work and share with community in March.
* Finalize SIG-validated high-level design in April.
* Sitemap
* Accept contractor bids, including billing rate and time estimate, in April.
* Identify and hire webdev/design contractor in April-May.
* Work begins in May, validated with Docs SIG continuously.
* Work completed by July 1.

## Design 

(In progress)

### Top Nav Menu
The current top nav will be condensed into 5 tabs:

* Getting Started
    * Basic conceptual info about Spinnaker for multiple personas.
    * Direct people to the next logical step for their persona
* Docs
    * All the current Spinnaker product documentation
* Community
    * Contributor Experience Resource, such as code and documentation contribution guide and contribution best practices and tips
    * Community Calendar
    * Usage stats
    * Governance & SIG info. This should be autogenerated from the Governance repo if possible. If not, we will continue to link to the Governance repo.
* News
    * Spinnaker newsletter
    * Featured videos
* Blog

### The refreshed home page should:
* Answer the question “Why Spinnaker” at high level and provide easy links to segmented answers (dev, c-level, director, partner etc)
  * IC: What does my life look like if I use Spinnaker?
  * Manager/Director: What does my life look like if my team uses Spinnaker?
  * C-level: What does my life look like if many of my key business objectives are tied to using Spinnaker?

### Documentation Features

* Versioned documentation that corresponds to Spinnaker versions. This is a small widget in the top nav. See K8s docs for an example.
* Page-level table of contents that is always visible. This provides context and makes navigation within a page easier. See Istio docs for an example. 

## Drawbacks
Will cost money, and cost needs to be negotiated amongst stakeholders.

## Prior Art and Alternatives

### Prior Art
For design, Tensorflow does a very good job of creating clearly defined entryways for different roles. Additionally, other open source projects have implemented the documentation features we want.

## Alternatives

* Do nothing
* Start completely over

## Known Unknowns
What do people outside of the Docs SIG want to see in a new Spinnaker.io?
What is the impact of Spinnaker.io on the contributor experience and Spinnaker adoption?

## Security, Privacy & Compliance

n/a

##  Operations
Our goal at this phase is to deliver a refresh that will not introduce significant operational changes for spinnaker.io. This refresh shouldn’t change anything from a contributor’s perspective, other than file locations.

## Risks

Should be minimal work, but unforeseen re-work could come up, expanding project scope.
We could alienate the community with misaligned branding or documentation organization.

## Future Possibilities
If we demonstrate that this refresh significantly increases traffic to spinnaker.io and supports Spinnaker success (i.e. increased traffic correlated with increased contributions/contributing company growth), we may later propose a more significant refresh. In doing so we’d like to avoid the K8S problem of having several contractors work on the site piecemeal, creating tech debt and knowledge scarcity. Our goal is to take a more pre-planned phased approach to improving the site.
