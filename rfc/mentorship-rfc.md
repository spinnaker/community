## Overview

This proposal describes an idea for a mentorship program for the Spinnaker OSS community that Ethan Rogers (`@ethanfrogers`), Rob Zienert (`@robzienert`), and I came up with.


### Goals and Non-Goals

The goal of this program is to create a more visible and structured way for new contributers to get the feedback they need to contribute successfully.

A secondary goal is to create more Approvers in the community and to encourage existing Approvers to provide more detailed PR review. 


## Motivation and Rationale


As a new (or prospective) contributor it's hard to break into a community where you have few connections. It's hard to understand how to add functionality or make improvements to Spinnaker. It's complicated to figure out who has the expertise to review your PR or provide design guidance.

As a maintainer, lots of time is spent providing feedback and PR review. That doesn't always lead to more quality PRs.

I'd like to create a more visible path to becoming an Approver (and the oportunity for help along the way).


## Design

### Find Mentors

To initially find mentors we would pick from current approvers in the community. We’d like to select contributors who are already producing quality PRs and who know a decent amount about Spinnaker architecture. Mentors must be willing to give prompt PR feedback, answer mentee questions on Slack, and generally guide a mentee for several months.

### Align Mentors

Mentors will meet together and set expectations on how to interact with mentees so that mentees have a consistent experience. 

### Find Mentees

Mentees will be found through self-nomination. We will put out a google form, and anyone in the community could sign up to be part of the mentorship program. From there, we will pick the same number of mentees as we have mentors. We want these mentees to be spread out between as many different companies as possible.

This google form will contain some information about what areas of interest a mentee has and what area of the code they’re planning to continue working in to help us match people up.

### Do Mentorship

The mentorship program would last for 3-6 months (hard stop at 6 months). This timeline is somewhat flexible to account for light/heavy quarters of work. It’s really up to the judgment of the pair on whether it’s working or not. 

**Mentor Expectations:** 

* Detailed and prompt PR review, explaining the “why” and not just what should be done (or, loop in a subject matter expert than can provide good review)

* Design guidance

* Biweekly check-in, ~ 30 minutes, for general questions and help

* Responsive to questions on slack

**Mentee Expectations:**

* Actively working on Spinnaker at a company that has a stake in Spinnaker

* Responds and learns from PR review

* Improve quality of the PR review they give by learning from the Mentor’s suggestions and spotting similar issues on other PRs

Mentors are not measured or judged on whether or not their mentee makes it to Approver status. Instead, mentors are qualitatively evaluated on things like quality of PR feedback and  responsiveness to questions (general gauge, not automatically or robotically measured).

### Recognize

Being a mentor requires a time investment. We’d like to give thanks for mentors because they’ll make a huge impact. Here are some ideas on how to do that:

* Can we spotlight mentors (and their companies) on our blog as permanent and visible recognition? This might help companies get excited about their engineers participating in this program because it’s recognition for them.

* Can we have a list of mentors and randomly have thanks to a person pop up in an app startup banner? This is much more targeted at showing other contributors that we value mentors.

* Can the TOC create some sort of “distinguished mentor” or “distinguished contributor” award which they give out for outstanding contributions?

### Repeat

If this is successful, we’d like to keep repeating the program. Ideally after some time (maybe 3-6 months later) past mentees are qualified and selected to be mentors. We want to set up a cycle of giving back to the community.


## Dependencies

This proposal requires someone to spend time organizing the program and providing support for mentors and mentees. Is that worth it?
