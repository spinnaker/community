### Find Help for Spinnaker

If you're using Spinnaker and could not find your answer in the documentation, start with [Slack](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/). Many Spinnaker contributors and users are active on the Spinnaker Slack. It's a great place to get answers to questions or start a discussion about a feature or topic. Good places to begin on Slack include the following channels: 

* A SIG channel if there is a relevant one, such as `#sig-security`. All SIG slack channels start with the prefix `sig`.
* A narrowly focused channel, such as #auth
* [#general](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/C091CCWRJ) for general questions and discussion 
* [#dev](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/C0DPVDMQE) for help contributing to Spinnaker

After engaging with the community to work through a problem, we encourage you to file an issue for the appropriate repo if you think it's needed. Reasons you might file an issue include the following: 

* Your problems are due to a bug or limitation that is not documented
* The documentation for something is confusing
* The behavior of a feature or field is unclear
