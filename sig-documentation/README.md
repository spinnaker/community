# Responsibilities

## Description

Documentation SIG is responsible for the direction and organization of the Spinnaker product documentation on https://www.spinnaker.io/. The SIG's responsibilities do not include documentation related to the governance of Spinnaker. The SIG also acts as a place where users and developers can find collaborators and get help creating or modifying documentation.

SIG leads and members will develop, maintain, and prioritize a backlog of documentation projects and requests. These projects and requests are macro-level issues, such as organization. They are independent of releases and features.  This prioritization will be published as the Documentation SIG Roadmap.

## Scope of Work and Goals

* Encourage Spinnaker adoption by creating helpful documentation.
* Establish a common framework for evaluating and improving documentation.
* Develop, encourage, and maintain a clearly defined structure and organization for the Spinnaker documentation.
* Help developers and SIGs create documentation for new features in Spinnaker.
* Propose and drive initiatives for code-driven doc generation.
* Facilitate community contributions to the Spinnaker documentation by creating templates and style guides.
* Maintain and improve the platform for building and publishing spinnaker.io.
