# Operational Validation Special Interest Group

# Responsibilities

## Description

Operational Validation is a general term meant to include monitoring and decision making inside Spinnaker based on observed behavior
of deployed applications, micro-services, and other software.
Canary deployments, simple metric monitoring, and other detection of issues in a production or semi-production environment are
common ways to identify issues in newly released code.  However, this SIG is not limited to deploy-time events.

## Scope of Work and Goals

* Establish a common framework for evaluating and improving validation techniques.
* Facilitate community contributions to the Spinnaker ecosystem where validation methods can be inserted into pipelines and other
decision points.
